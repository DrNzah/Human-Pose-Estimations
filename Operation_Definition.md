**Operation Definition for Human Pose Estimation:**

Human Pose Estimation is the computational process of determining and representing the spatial positions and orientations of key anatomical landmarks, such as joints and body parts, within an image or a sequence of images.

This operation involves the following steps:

1. **Image Acquisition:** Obtain one or more images or frames containing human subjects. These images can be captured using cameras, depth sensors, or other imaging devices.

2. **Preprocessing:** Perform image preprocessing, which may include resizing, normalization, and noise reduction, to ensure that the input images are suitable for analysis.

3. **Feature Extraction:** Identify relevant features or keypoints in the image that correspond to specific body parts or joints. These keypoints can include locations like the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.

4. **Pose Estimation:** Utilize computer vision techniques and algorithms to estimate the spatial coordinates, angles, or orientations of the identified keypoints in the image(s). This estimation can involve classical computer vision methods or deep learning-based approaches.

5. **Post-processing:** Refine the estimated poses, which may include smoothing noisy predictions, handling occlusions, and ensuring anatomical consistency.

6. **Output Representation:** Present the results as a structured representation of the human pose, often as a set of coordinate values or joint angles, making it possible to interpret and use the pose information.

7. **Evaluation (Optional):** Assess the accuracy and reliability of the pose estimation results using relevant metrics or benchmarks, such as Mean Average Precision (mAP) or Intersection over Union (IoU).

This operation definition outlines the systematic process for estimating the spatial configuration of a human body's key points within an image, enabling applications across various domains, including computer vision, robotics, healthcare, and entertainment.
