A systematic literature review (SLR) is a rigorous and structured approach to gather and evaluate existing research on a specific topic. Here are the guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review on the topic of human pose estimation:

**1. Define Your Research Question:**
   - Clearly state your research question or objective. For example, "What are the current techniques and advancements in human pose estimation?"

**2. Develop Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:**
   - Specify the criteria for including or excluding studies. This could include publication date, type of research (e.g., empirical studies, reviews, or surveys), and relevance to your research question.

**3. Search Strategy:**
   - Develop a comprehensive search strategy to identify relevant literature. Utilize academic databases (e.g., PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar), keywords, and search terms related to human pose estimation.
   - Keep a record of the search strategy and the number of results obtained at each stage.

**4. Selection of Studies:**
   - Screen the search results based on your inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   - Conduct a two-step screening process: title/abstract screening followed by full-text screening.
   - Use reference management software to organize and keep track of selected studies.

**5. Data Extraction:**
   - Create a structured data extraction form to collect relevant information from each selected study. Include details such as the publication year, research methodology, dataset used, algorithms, and results.
   - Ensure consistency and accuracy in data extraction.

**6. Quality Assessment:**
   - Evaluate the quality of the selected studies. Use appropriate quality assessment tools or criteria depending on the type of studies (e.g., PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews, or specific quality assessment tools for quantitative and qualitative studies).

**7. Data Synthesis:**
   - Summarize the findings from the selected studies. Organize the information according to themes or categories.
   - Consider using tables, graphs, or other visual aids to present the synthesized data.

**8. Critical Appraisal:**
   - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the included studies. Assess the overall quality of the evidence.

**9. Identify Research Gaps:**
   - Based on your synthesis and critical appraisal, identify gaps in the existing literature.
   - Discuss areas where further research is needed or where improvements can be made.

**10. Conclusion and Recommendations:**
    - Summarize the key findings of your systematic literature review.
    - Provide recommendations for researchers, practitioners, or policymakers based on the insights gained.

**11. Write the Review:**
    - Prepare a well-structured research paper following the guidelines of a relevant academic style (e.g., APA, IEEE).
    - Clearly articulate the research question, methodology, findings, and conclusions.

**12. Peer Review:**
    - Seek feedback from peers or experts in the field to enhance the quality of your review.

**13. Update Regularly:**
    - Given that the field of human pose estimation may evolve rapidly, consider updating your review at regular intervals to incorporate new research.

**14. Ethical Considerations:**
    - Adhere to ethical guidelines and properly attribute the work of others by citing sources appropriately.

**15. References:**
    - Compile a comprehensive list of references from the studies included in your review.

A well-executed systematic literature review on human pose estimation will provide a valuable overview of the current state of the field, highlight research gaps, and guide future research efforts.
